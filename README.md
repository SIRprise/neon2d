## Big changes ahead!
neonGL is the next step for the neon2d engine. It will allow us to render without all the extra bloat of using Windows Forms. If your into that kind of thing check out [the info page](https://neon2d.github.io/neonGL) or check out [the repository itself](https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d) which is still in the early stages of development

## Building neon through AppVeyor
The latest commit of neon2d is built automatically through AppVeyor at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matthewd673/neon2d. This is our primary method for finding problems after building (errors with other environments).

## Important:

The n2d project is a demo project

While */packages* is not empty, none of the packages are used

## Where do I start?

The project wiki is an excellent place to get started! It has very simple tutorials to get you up and running with neon2d in no time!

## Are there demos (other than *n2d*)?

Yeah! @matthewd673 recently made a game with neon2d available [on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/egq13mif5twae0k/AACt4oJ782f2dl4CIHXKiDcla?dl=0)!
